methods: We use a discrete time SEIR compartmental model with explicit strain modeling fit to observed cases at the state level. The fitting procedure takes into account variable case ascertainment rate informed by CDC seroprevalence surveys, growth of omicron variant prevalence assumed to be 0.32 with current levels provided by CDC at HHS region, and ongoing vaccination rates (all at the state level). Vaccine efficacy against infection/disease are assumed to be the same, and acceptance levels are assigned by state using latest estimates from COVIDcast Facebook surveys. Hospitalizations and death outcomes are obtained by using an age-stratified adjustment over three age groups (0-18, 18-65 and 65+) with scaling factors to match the respective ground truths and adjusted per strain. Uncertainty bounds are obtained by using an experiment design over other model parameters such as infectious/incubation periods, reporting delay and bounds on ascertainment rates.
modeling_NPI: NPI impact and adjustments are done by proxy using the fitted transmissibility. The current level of transmissibility after modeling strain effects is assumed in the future.
