methods: State-level metapopulation model with commuting and stochastic SEIR disease dynamics
  with social-distancing indicators.
modeling_NPI: "Stay-at-home orders and 
  \ subsequent social distancing interventions are updated at the state-level according \
  \ to recent policy documents. Ongoing interventions continued through \
  \ the remainder of the simulation period. Intervention effects are inferred \
  \ where  possible."
compliance_NPI: Not applicable
contact_tracing: Not applicable
testing: Not applicable
vaccine_efficacy_transmission: "Vaccine efficacy is assumed to be against infection, not specifically \
  \ transmission. Vaccine efficacy estimates are assumed based on the scenarios."
vaccine_efficacy_delay: Immunity is assumed to develop exactly 14 days after vaccination.
vaccine_hesitancy: Hesitancy is not assumed other than specifically indicated by the scenarios.
vaccine_immunity_duration: Not applicable
natural_immunity_duration: Not applicable
case_fatality_rate: Not applicable
infection_fatality_rate: Age-adjusted based on population age distribution and age-distribution of those 
  \ who have received at least one vaccine dose. US national CFR set at 5%.
asymptomatics: Not applicable
age_groups: Not applicable
importations: Functionality in place, but not currently in use.
confidence_interval_method: We compute confidence intervals as quantiles across 300 simulations.
calibration: "We use an  MCMC-like inference procedure that calibrates model outputs to weekly \       
  \ aggregations of incident confirmed cases and deaths as reported by USA Facts. For the \
  \ inference of the baseline reproductive number and the case  confirmation to infection ratio, \
  \ hierarchical grouping terms enable sharing  of strength among counties in the same state."
spatial_structure: state-level metapopulation accounting for spatial mobility using community data between states.

methods_long: "This is a county-level metapopulation model with stochastic SEIR disease 
  \  dynamics. This model incorporates uncertainty in epidemiological parameters \
  \ and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on social distancing\
  \ and stay-at-home orders. Infections are seeded stochastically with roughly 10\
  \ times the number of confirmed cases in the first five days of a county epidemic\
  \ and R0 and the duration of the infectious period were drawn stochastically for\
  \ each county and simulation. Disease follows SEIR dynamics and county commuting\
  \ data modulates the spread of disease within counties. \nStay-at-home orders and \
  \ subsequent social distancing interventions are updated at the state-level according \
  \ to recent policy documents. Ongoing interventions continued through \
  \ the remainder of the simulation period. Intervention effects are inferred \
  \ where possible.\n
  To model deaths and hospitalizations in the population, we incorporated\
  \ realistic but fixed time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to \
  \ ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to perform \
  \ a county-level age standardization of health outcome risk. Currently, we assume\
  \ a 0.5% infection fatality rate and a 3.5:1 ratio of incident hospitalizations\
  \ to deaths. Infection fatality rates and hospitalization rates are adjusted to\
  \ account for the age distribution of individuals who have received at least one
  \ dose of the vaccine. Weekly adjustments to R0 are made to account for the growing\
  \ prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant, which is assumed to be 50% more transmissible\
  \ and to reach 100% dominance in the US by May.\n 
  For each county, we estimate the seeding time and amount,\
  \ the baseline reproductive number, the case confirmation to infection ratio, and\
  \ the effectiveness of interventions (from closing to phased reopenings). We use an\ 
  \ MCMC-like inference procedure that calibrates model outputs to weekly county\
  \ aggregations of incident confirmed cases and deaths as reported by USA Facts. For\
  \ the inference of the baseline reproductive number and the case confirmation to\
  \ infection ratio, hierarchical grouping terms enable sharing of strength among\
  \ counties in the same state.\n\
  Our procedure forecasts incident and cumulative deaths by incorporating the last\
  \ reported data point (pre-forecast date) from USA Facts.\nThe estimates reported\
  \ by this model incorporate uncertainty in both epidemiological parameters (e.g.,\
  \ R0, infectious period, time delays to health outcomes) and the effectiveness\
  \ of state-wide intervention policies on social distancing, stay-at-home orders,\
  \ and phased reopenings. We submit a single calibration to forecast deaths, cases,\
  \ and hospitalizations."
