## Initial variant characteristics (including Omicron transmissibility, immune escape, whether BA4/BA5 were considered and how uncertainty or non-identifiability was handled) 
FILL

## Process for setting/calibrating P(hosp given current infection) and P(death given current infection)
FILL

## Waning immunity details (including values used for the duration and level of protection against infection or symptomatic disease, whether a point estimate was used or a sample from the specified values, distribution used)
FILL

## Seasonality implementation
FILL

## Emerging variant details (including introduction process and estimate of variant X emergence timing and variability)
FILL

## Nonpharmaceutical interventions 
FILL

## Case ascertainment assumptions (including relation to infections, e.g., what value or values were used to translate to case estimates and how were they estimated)
FILL

## Other updates in model assumptions from previous rounds (e.g., booster implementation)
