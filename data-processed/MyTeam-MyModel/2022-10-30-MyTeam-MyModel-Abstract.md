# Explanation of observed dynamics given model assumptions
FILL

# Model assumptions
## Number/type of immune classes considered
FILL

## Initial distribution of susceptibility if available
FILL (if available)

## Initial variant characteristics (transmissibility of BA4/BA5 were considered and how uncertainty or non-identifiability was handled)
FILL

## Process for setting/calibrating P(hosp given current infection) and P(death given current infection)
FILL

## Waning immunity against infection and symptoms details (including values used for the duration and level of protection against infection or symptomatic disease, whether a point estimate was used or a sample from the specified values, distribution used)
FILL

## Waning immunity against severe disease (including whether immunity against severe disease, conditional on infection, is fixed vs declines over time; and if it wanes, specify distribution)
FILL

## Seasonality implementation
FILL

## Emerging variants details (including transmissibility of level 5 vs level 6/7)
FILL

## Nonpharmaceutical interventions 
FILL

## Case ascertainment assumptions (including relation to infections, e.g., what value or values were used to translate to case estimates and how were they estimated)
FILL

## Assumptions about booster vaccine coverage (e.g., saturation levels, age and state variability)
FILL

## Other updates in model assumptions from previous rounds (e.g., disease severity, reporting)
